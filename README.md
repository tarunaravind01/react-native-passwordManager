# react-native-passwordManager
a simplistic and secure password store

This is a very simple and basic password store. The cool feature of this app is that it uses IOS keychain services for Apple and in Android we use the sharedPreferences secure store. 

To install --> `npm install`

You can use expo to run this app --> `expo start`
